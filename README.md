# Environment Manager
The Environment Manager is a tool you can use to manage and organize environment settings for reusable development needs such as at a specific client or project level. For example, you might have multiple projects for a specific client that all use the same form template (e.g., one with the client's logo) and environment settings (e.g., data paths). The Environment Manager lets you create environment sets which are packages of settings you can apply at any time. These settings include SET commands, Form and Formset templates, and Field class mappings.
